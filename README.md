# runaway-button

A fun little game where a button tries to escape your mouse.  
Catch it if you can! ðŸŸ©

## How it works

- Move your mouse toward the button â€” it runs away.
- If you manage to click it â€” you win!
- No frameworks, no dependencies â€” just pure HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Run locally

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trainymonked/runaway-button.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Files

- `index.html` â€” core HTML and JavaScript logic
- `style` and `script` are inline for simplicity

## Why?

Because coding should sometimes be _just fun_.
